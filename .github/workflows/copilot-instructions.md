## General guidelines
- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase.
- Write clear, concise, and maintainable code.
- Always ask clarifying questions if any requirements or specifications are unclear.
- Don't start writing code until you have a complete understanding of the task at hand, and have confirmation from the user.

## Repository layout
- Source code lives in the `src/` directory.
- The design and feature requirements are located in docs/design.md, which you must refer to when implementing features. You MUST also keep this document updated with any changes.
- Task breakdowns and progress tracking are in docs/tasks.md, organized by development phases. You must also keep this document updated as you identify and complete new tasks.
